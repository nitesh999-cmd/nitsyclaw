# Testing — NitsyClaw

Per Constitution **R15**, every P0 feature has unit + integration coverage. CI gates: 70% lines, 65% branches.

Current verified gate from the latest local check:

- `pnpm lint` passes.
- `pnpm typecheck` passes.
- `pnpm test` passes.
- `pnpm build` passes.
- Playwright E2E dashboard specs pass.
- Semgrep: 0 findings.
- `pnpm audit --audit-level=moderate`: no known vulnerabilities.

## Current counts

Do not hard-code current test counts in this doc. Vitest and Playwright print the exact file/spec counts during each run, and those numbers drift whenever coverage improves.

## Running

```bash
pnpm test              # all unit + integration
pnpm test:watch        # vitest in watch mode
pnpm test:coverage     # generate coverage/ HTML + lcov
pnpm test:e2e          # Playwright (auto-starts dashboard)
pnpm test:e2e --ui     # Playwright UI mode
pnpm release:live-smoke # smoke-test production after deploy
pnpm run audit:doctor   # check local Docker, Vercel CLI, symlink, and live health blockers
```

`pnpm release:preflight` also blocks local secret drift before release. It fails if OAuth tokens, `.env.local`, SQLite/DB files, or WhatsApp session folders are left inside the repo instead of the external secret root.

`pnpm run audit:doctor` is intentionally stricter about machine readiness. It fails if Docker is missing or Windows symlink privilege blocks local Vercel prebuilt packaging.

## Production smoke

After any production deploy, run:

```powershell
pnpm release:live-smoke
```

This checks:

- `/api/healthz` returns `200`, `ok=true`, and `Cache-Control: no-store`
- `/privacy` and `/terms` are public and no-store
- `/api/sale-readiness` and `/api/chat/history` reject unauthenticated access with `401`
- `/login` contains `Personal life admin`
- `/login` does not contain the old `Personal AI control plane` copy

## Tagged tests

- `@live` — require real WhatsApp/Anthropic/OpenAI keys. Skipped in CI by name filter.
- Run live tests locally: `pnpm test --reporter=verbose -t "@live"`.

## Test data

Every test gets a fresh in-memory fake DB via `makeFakeDb()` in `packages/shared/test/helpers.ts`. No shared state. No real Postgres needed for unit tests.

For Drizzle queries that need real SQL, install `pg-mem` and add a setup helper. v1 doesn't need it — fake DB covers feature flow assertions.

## What we test by feature

| Feature | Unit | Integration | E2E |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Text command | classify, reply tool | router → reply | — |
| 2. Voice capture | transcribe, store, error paths | router → transcribe → ack | — |
| 3. Reminders | parse, plan, fire-due | — | — |
| 4. Morning brief | build, send | — | Today page |
| 5. What's on my plate | summarize empty | — | Today page |
| 6. Memory recall | pin, recall round trip | — | Memory page |
| 7. Schedule call | tool, validation, errors | — | — |
| 8. Web research | summarize, empty results | — | — |
| 9. Confirmation rail | yes/no/expired/null | router (no pending) | — |
| 10. Receipt expense | categorize, OCR, parse | router → image → log | Expenses page |

Plus generic infrastructure: agent loop (4 tests), tool registry (5), env validation (3), crypto (5), WhatsApp mock (4).
