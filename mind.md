## 1. What this project is

**NitsyClaw** is Nitesh's personal AI assistant.

- **Channels:** WhatsApp self-chat (primary), Vercel dashboard at https://nitsyclaw.vercel.app (browser, anywhere)
- **Brain:** Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.6 with tool use (10 P0 features + safe queued tools)
- **Hosting:** local laptop (always-on) for the bot, Vercel for the dashboard, Supabase for the DB. Cloud bot abandoned (see §10).
- **Owner number:** `61430008008` (Australia)
- **Timezone:** `Australia/Melbourne`

One-line pitch: "Text or voice-note NitsyClaw on WhatsApp. It does the work. The dashboard at nitsyclaw.vercel.app is where I check, edit, and steer it."

## 2. Stack (locked — Constitution R13–R16)

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript (Node 20+) |
| Monorepo | pnpm workspaces |
| WhatsApp | whatsapp-web.js + LocalAuth (Path B — personal, single-recipient) |
| LLM | Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.6 |
| Voice (input) | OpenAI Whisper API |
| DB | Supabase Postgres + pgvector |
| ORM | Drizzle |
| Dashboard | Next.js 16.2.6 + Tailwind + shadcn-flavored components |
| Tests | Vitest + Playwright |
| Hosting (dashboard) | **Vercel — `nitsyclaw.vercel.app`** |
| Hosting (bot) | **Local PC (always-on, hidden, auto-restart)** |
| Scheduler | node-cron inside the bot |
| Email/calendar (Google) | googleapis (multi-account labeled tokens) |
| Email/calendar (Microsoft) | Microsoft Graph (device-code OAuth) |

Cloud bot via Railway/whatsapp-web.js was attempted and **abandoned** (see §10).

## 3. Agent dependency boundary

Current status: the multi-account aggregators are behind `AgentDeps`; shared feature code must not import from `apps/bot/*`.

What is true in `main`:

- `packages/shared/src/agent/deps.ts` exposes `aggregator?: AggregatorClient`.
- `packages/shared/src/features/04-morning-brief.ts` uses `ctx.deps.aggregator?.fetchAllEventsToday(...)` and `ctx.deps.aggregator?.fetchAllUnreadEmails(...)`.
- `packages/shared/src/features/05-whats-on-my-plate.ts` uses `args.deps.aggregator?.fetchAllEventsToday(...)`.
- `apps/bot/src/adapters.ts` wires the real Google/Microsoft aggregators into `buildAgentDeps()`.
- Dashboard deps leave `aggregator` undefined, so dashboard builds stay isolated from bot-only code and features safely fall back to empty arrays.

Verification run on 2026-05-12:

- `pnpm -r typecheck`
- `pnpm run build`
- `pnpm run release:preflight`

Remaining parked work:

- Yahoo IMAP integration is parked until usable auth is available.
- Dashboard voice transcription is parked; dashboard chat still uses the no-op transcriber path.
