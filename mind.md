## 1. What this project is

**NitsyClaw** is Nitesh's personal AI assistant.

- **Channels:** WhatsApp self-chat (primary), Vercel dashboard at https://nitsyclaw.vercel.app (browser, anywhere)
- **Brain:** Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.6 with tool use (10 P0 features + safe queued tools)
- **Hosting:** local laptop (always-on) for the bot, Vercel for the dashboard, Supabase for the DB. Cloud bot abandoned (see §10).
- **Owner number:** `61430008008` (Australia)
- **Timezone:** `Australia/Melbourne`

One-line pitch: "Text or voice-note NitsyClaw on WhatsApp. It does the work. The dashboard at nitsyclaw.vercel.app is where I check, edit, and steer it."

## 2. Stack (locked — Constitution R13–R16)

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript (Node 20+) |
| Monorepo | pnpm workspaces |
| WhatsApp | whatsapp-web.js + LocalAuth (Path B — personal, single-recipient) |
| LLM | Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.6 |
| Voice (input) | OpenAI Whisper API |
| DB | Supabase Postgres + pgvector |
| ORM | Drizzle |
| Dashboard | Next.js 16.2.6 + Tailwind + shadcn-flavored components |
| Tests | Vitest + Playwright |
| Hosting (dashboard) | **Vercel — `nitsyclaw.vercel.app`** |
| Hosting (bot) | **Local PC (always-on, hidden, auto-restart)** |
| Scheduler | node-cron inside the bot |
| Email/calendar (Google) | googleapis (multi-account labeled tokens) |
| Email/calendar (Microsoft) | Microsoft Graph (device-code OAuth) |

Cloud bot via Railway/whatsapp-web.js was attempted and **abandoned** (see §10).

## 3. Agent dependency boundary

Current status: the multi-account aggregators are behind `AgentDeps`; shared feature code must not import from `apps/bot/*`.

What is true in `main`:

- `packages/shared/src/agent/deps.ts` exposes `aggregator?: AggregatorClient`.
- `packages/shared/src/features/04-morning-brief.ts` uses `ctx.deps.aggregator?.fetchAllEventsToday(...)` and `ctx.deps.aggregator?.fetchAllUnreadEmails(...)`.
- `packages/shared/src/features/05-whats-on-my-plate.ts` uses `args.deps.aggregator?.fetchAllEventsToday(...)`.
- `apps/bot/src/adapters.ts` wires the real Google/Microsoft aggregators into `buildAgentDeps()`.
- Dashboard deps leave `aggregator` undefined, so dashboard builds stay isolated from bot-only code and features safely fall back to empty arrays.

Verification run on 2026-05-12:

- `pnpm -r typecheck`
- `pnpm run build`
- `pnpm run release:preflight`

Remaining parked work:

- Yahoo IMAP integration is parked until usable auth is available.
- Dashboard voice transcription is parked; dashboard chat still uses the no-op transcriber path.

## 15. Session 2026-05-16 — Daily build agent run (BLOCKED)

**Date:** 2026-05-16
**Agent:** Daily build agent (NWP-Constitution-v1.2, R36)
**Result:** 0 done, 0 rejected, 0 implemented — blocked by network policy

### What happened

The CCR build agent fired and attempted to process pending `feature_requests` rows per R36 + R35. Boot sequence completed (NWP-CONSTITUTION-v1.2, mind.md, NitsyClaw-Constitution-v1.0.md, CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE-CODE-BACKLOG.md, schema.ts confirmed). Connection to Postgres failed due to remote execution environment network policy.

### Network diagnostics

| Target | Port | Result |
|---|---|---|
| aws-1-ap-northeast-1.pooler.supabase.com | 6543 (Supabase pooler) | TCP FAILED (timeout) |
| aws-1-ap-northeast-1.pooler.supabase.com | 5432 | TCP FAILED (timeout) |
| db.pdonjcqxrijgefdeydxj.supabase.co | 5432 | DNS not resolved |
| ntfy.sh | 443 | 403 "Host not in allowlist" |
| pdonjcqxrijgefdeydxj.supabase.co | 443 | Connected (HTTPS works, but no JWT to use REST API) |
| api.anthropic.com | 443 | Accessible |
| github.com | 443 | Accessible |

### Root cause

The Claude Code on the web environment uses a network allowlist policy. This environment allows `github.com` and `api.anthropic.com` but NOT Supabase PostgreSQL TCP connections or ntfy.sh. Without a TCP path to Postgres (ports 5432/6543), and without Supabase REST API JWT keys (project uses raw Drizzle/postgres, not supabase-js), no DB queries were possible.

### Lesson L38 — Daily build agent needs REST API access path, not TCP-only

The build agent as designed requires TCP access to Supabase PostgreSQL. Cloud CI/CD environments typically block raw TCP on non-HTTPS ports. To make the build agent work from Claude Code on the web:

**Option A:** Add a lightweight `/api/build-agent/pending` route to the Vercel dashboard that queries `feature_requests WHERE status='pending'` and returns the rows (protected by the dashboard password). The build agent can then call this HTTPS endpoint instead of direct Postgres.

**Option B:** Store the Supabase anon or service_role JWT in the CCR environment secrets so the build agent can use the Supabase REST API (PostgREST) over HTTPS.

**Option C:** Run the daily build agent only from the local laptop bot process (via `BUILD_AGENT_CRON`), not from Claude Code on the web. This was the original design (CLAUDE-CODE-BACKLOG.md §Build agent status, 2026-04-29).

Recommended: Option A — adds a thin Vercel API route, no secrets required beyond the existing dashboard password. The build agent authenticates to `/api/build-agent/pending` with `Authorization: Bearer <DASHBOARD_PASSWORD>`, gets pending rows, claims each via the same API, and pushes commits.

### Session log

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| Boot sequence | Completed |
| Query pending feature_requests | FAILED — TCP blocked |
| ntfy start notification | FAILED — host not in allowlist |
| Features implemented | 0 |
| mind.md updated | YES (this entry) |
| Committed + pushed | YES |
