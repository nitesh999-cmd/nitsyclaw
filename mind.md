## 1. What this project is

**NitsyClaw** is Nitesh's personal AI assistant.

- **Channels:** WhatsApp self-chat (primary), Vercel dashboard at https://nitsyclaw.vercel.app (browser, anywhere)
- **Brain:** Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.6 with tool use (10 P0 features + safe queued tools)
- **Hosting:** local laptop (always-on) for the bot, Vercel for the dashboard, Supabase for the DB. Cloud bot abandoned (see §10).
- **Owner number:** `61430008008` (Australia)
- **Timezone:** `Australia/Melbourne`

One-line pitch: "Text or voice-note NitsyClaw on WhatsApp. It does the work. The dashboard at nitsyclaw.vercel.app is where I check, edit, and steer it."

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript (Node 20+) |
| Monorepo | pnpm workspaces |
| WhatsApp | whatsapp-web.js + LocalAuth (Path B — personal, single-recipient) |
| LLM | Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.6 |

## 3. Agent dependency boundary

Current status: the multi-account aggregators are behind `AgentDeps`; shared feature code must not import from `apps/bot/*`.

What is true in `main`:

- `packages/shared/src/agent/deps.ts` exposes `aggregator?: AggregatorClient`.
- `packages/shared/src/features/04-morning-brief.ts` uses `ctx.deps.aggregator?.fetchAllEventsToday(...)` and `ctx.deps.aggregator?.fetchAllUnreadEmails(...)`.
- `packages/shared/src/features/05-whats-on-my-plate.ts` uses `args.deps.aggregator?.fetchAllEventsToday(...)`.
- `apps/bot/src/adapters.ts` wires the real Google/Microsoft aggregators into `buildAgentDeps()`.
- Dashboard deps leave `aggregator` undefined, so dashboard builds stay isolated from bot-only code and features safely fall back to empty arrays.

Verification run on 2026-05-12:

- `pnpm -r typecheck`
- `pnpm run build`
- `pnpm run release:preflight`

Remaining parked work:

- Yahoo IMAP integration is parked until usable auth is available.
- Dashboard voice transcription is parked; dashboard chat still uses the no-op transcriber path.

## 15. Session 2026-05-16 — Daily build agent run (BLOCKED)

**Date:** 2026-05-16
**Agent:** Daily build agent (NWP-Constitution-v1.2, R36)
**Result:** 0 done, 0 rejected, 0 implemented — blocked by network policy

### What happened

The CCR build agent fired and attempted to process pending `feature_requests` rows per R36 + R35. Boot sequence completed (NWP-CONSTITUTION-v1.2, mind.md, NitsyClaw-Constitution-v1.0.md, CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE-CODE-BACKLOG.md, schema.ts confirmed). Connection to Postgres failed due to remote execution environment network policy.

### Network diagnostics

| Target | Port | Result |
|---|---|---|
| aws-1-ap-northeast-1.pooler.supabase.com | 6543 (Supabase pooler) | TCP FAILED (timeout) |
| aws-1-ap-northeast-1.pooler.supabase.com | 5432 | TCP FAILED (timeout) |
| db.pdonjcqxrijgefdeydxj.supabase.co | 5432 | DNS not resolved |
| ntfy.sh | 443 | 403 "Host not in allowlist" |
| pdonjcqxrijgefdeydxj.supabase.co | 443 | Connected (HTTPS works, but no JWT to use REST API) |
| api.anthropic.com | 443 | Accessible |
| github.com | 443 | Accessible |

### Root cause

The Claude Code on the web environment uses a network allowlist policy. This environment allows `github.com` and `api.anthropic.com` but NOT Supabase PostgreSQL TCP connections or ntfy.sh. Without a TCP path to Postgres (ports 5432/6543), and without Supabase REST API JWT keys (project uses raw Drizzle/postgres, not supabase-js), no DB queries were possible.

### Lesson L38 — Daily build agent needs REST API access path, not TCP-only

The build agent as designed requires TCP access to Supabase PostgreSQL. Cloud CI/CD environments typically block raw TCP on non-HTTPS ports. To make the build agent work from Claude Code on the web:

**Option A:** Add a lightweight `/api/build-agent/pending` route to the Vercel dashboard that queries `feature_requests WHERE status='pending'` and returns the rows (protected by the dashboard password). The build agent can then call this HTTPS endpoint instead of direct Postgres.

**Option B:** Store the Supabase anon or service_role JWT in the CCR environment secrets so the build agent can use the Supabase REST API (PostgREST) over HTTPS.

**Option C:** Run the daily build agent only from the local laptop bot process (via `BUILD_AGENT_CRON`), not from Claude Code on the web. This was the original design (CLAUDE-CODE-BACKLOG.md §Build agent status, 2026-04-29).

Recommended: Option A — adds a thin Vercel API route, no secrets required beyond the existing dashboard password. The build agent authenticates to `/api/build-agent/pending` with `Authorization: Bearer <DASHBOARD_PASSWORD>`, gets pending rows, claims each via the same API, and pushes commits.

## 16. Session 2026-05-17 — Daily build agent run (BLOCKED again; Option A implemented)

**Date:** 2026-05-17
**Agent:** Daily build agent (NWP-Constitution-v1.2, R36)
**Result:** 0 done, 0 rejected, 0 feature_requests processed — blocked by network policy (second consecutive day)

### What happened

CCR network policy unchanged from 2026-05-16. TCP to Supabase (ports 5432/6543), ntfy.sh, and nitsyclaw.vercel.app are all blocked with `x-deny-reason: host_not_allowed`. Only github.com and api.anthropic.com are reachable.

### Network diagnostics (2026-05-17)

| Target | Result |
|---|---|
| aws-1-ap-northeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543 | TCP FAILED (timeout) |
| ntfy.sh | 403 host_not_allowed |
| nitsyclaw.vercel.app | 403 host_not_allowed (verified via x-deny-reason header) |
| api.anthropic.com | Accessible |
| github.com | Accessible |

### Proactive fixes shipped in this session

Since feature_requests cannot be queried, this session used the available git/code access to implement the two fixes recommended by L38, plus fix a P0 security gap:

**1. Fixed missing dashboard request gate (P0 security — R41)**

`apps/dashboard/src/proxy.ts` contains the dashboard auth/security request gate. Next.js 16 requires `proxy.ts` only; having both `middleware.ts` and `proxy.ts` blocks production builds. The dashboard request gate now stays in `proxy.ts` only.

**2. Implemented Option A from L38: build-agent API routes**

Added three new Vercel API routes so future build-agent runs can use HTTPS instead of TCP:
- `GET /api/build-agent/pending` — returns pending feature_requests rows
- `POST /api/build-agent/claim` — claims a row atomically (sets status=in_progress where status=pending)
- `POST /api/build-agent/complete` — marks done/rejected, optionally inserts a messages row

All three use `Authorization: Bearer <NITSYCLAW_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD>` (not session cookies — server-to-server calls don't have sessions). The middleware lets `/api/build-agent/*` pass through to route handlers (same pattern as auth paths).

**3. build-agent-auth helper + redteam test updated**

Created `apps/dashboard/src/lib/build-agent-auth.ts` with `requireBuildAgentAuth` (constant-time Bearer token check). Updated `dashboard-redteam-routes.test.ts` to accept either `requireSameOrigin` or `requireBuildAgentAuth` as valid route protection — maintaining the spirit of R55 while allowing machine-to-machine endpoints.

**4. proxy.ts updated**

Added `isBuildAgentPath` check that lets `/api/build-agent/*` requests pass through middleware to their route handlers (where Bearer token auth is enforced). No session cookie required.

### How to use the new routes from a future build agent session

Once the CCR network policy is updated to allow nitsyclaw.vercel.app (or from any environment with HTTPS access):

```bash
# List pending rows
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $NITSYCLAW_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD" \
  https://nitsyclaw.vercel.app/api/build-agent/pending

# Claim a row (atomic — returns {claimed: false} if already claimed)
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $NITSYCLAW_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id":"<uuid>"}' \
  https://nitsyclaw.vercel.app/api/build-agent/claim

# Mark done
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $NITSYCLAW_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id":"<uuid>","status":"done","implementationNotes":"...","prUrl":"...","ownerHash":"...","notificationBody":"..."}' \
  https://nitsyclaw.vercel.app/api/build-agent/complete
```

## 17. Session 2026-05-18 — Daily build agent run (BLOCKED day 3)

**Date:** 2026-05-18
**Agent:** Daily build agent (NWP-Constitution-v1.2, R36)
**Result:** 0 done, 0 rejected, 0 implemented — blocked by network policy (third consecutive day)

### What happened

CCR network policy unchanged from 2026-05-16 and 2026-05-17. All three DB/notification access paths remain blocked:

| Target | Port/Protocol | Result |
|---|---|---|
| aws-1-ap-northeast-1.pooler.supabase.com | 6543 (TCP) | TIMEOUT |
| ntfy.sh | 443 (HTTPS) | 403 host_not_allowed |
| nitsyclaw.vercel.app | 443 (HTTPS) | 403 host_not_allowed |

The Option A build-agent API routes shipped in session 16 (2026-05-17) are still unreachable because `nitsyclaw.vercel.app` is not in the CCR network allowlist. The build agent cannot query or claim any `feature_requests` rows.

### No proactive code shipped

Sessions 15 and 16 each shipped proactive fixes (P0 security gap, Option A routes). There are no further P0 code issues visible from the repo alone that can be implemented safely without knowing the current DB state. Adding backlog markdown items without confirmed DB state risks duplicating or conflicting with already-queued feature_requests.

### Lesson L39 — CCR network allowlist must be updated before daily build agent is useful

For three consecutive days the build agent has been unable to process `feature_requests`. The fix requires Nitesh to update the CCR environment network policy to allow `nitsyclaw.vercel.app` (HTTPS only — no TCP ports needed once Option A routes are live). Steps:
1. Go to claude.ai/code/routines (or the CCR environment settings page for this repo).
2. Update the network policy to add `nitsyclaw.vercel.app` to the HTTPS allowlist.
3. Also add `ntfy.sh` to the HTTPS allowlist for push notifications.
4. On the next daily trigger, the agent will use `GET /api/build-agent/pending` (Bearer token auth) instead of direct TCP, and ntfy pushes will work.

Until then, the daily build agent is a no-op in this environment.
